# Security Policy

Hi! Thank you for your interest in AdventureLookup's security policy.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We don't really have a dedicated process for reporting a security vulnerability.
Please **do NOT** open a GitHub Issue if you think you found a security vulnerability.
Instead, reach out to Christian Flach ([@cmfcmf](https://github.com/cmfcmf)) by some other means, 
e.g. via private message on reddit or Twitter, or via email (address can be found [here](https://github.com/cmfcmf)).
