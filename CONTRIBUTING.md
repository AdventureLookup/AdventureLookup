# Contribution Guidelines

First of all, thank you for contributing to AdventureLookup! :100:

If you have a question, suggestion, feedback or bug report, don't hesitate to open
a new issue.

## Working on an Issue

If you see an open issue you'd like to work on, please leave a comment on the issue.
This way, everyone knows you're currently working on it. Please note: We can't 
assign you to the issue through GitHub's web UI, because GitHub doesn't allow us to 
assign non-collaborators to issues. Don't worry though, an issue you claim with a 
comment will still be yours to work on.

Please push your changes to a new branch in your fork and create a pull request
from there. We use forks to keep the main repository free from unnecessary branches.

If you haven't already, make sure to setup your development environment using
Vagrant like described in the README. Please open an issue if you run into issues 
with setting up your development environment.

## Creating Pull Requests

Please create all pull requests from and against the `dev` branch. The `dev` branch
is always live at https://dev.adventurelookup.com.
We'll merge the `dev` branch into `master` from time to time, which is deployed to
https://adventurelookup.com.

You're welcome to open your pull request early, even if you are still working on the 
fix or feature. This way we can give you early feedback on your changes and the 
direction you are going. If you open your pull request early, please indicate so by 
prepending "WIP: " ("Work In Progress") to your pull request's title.
